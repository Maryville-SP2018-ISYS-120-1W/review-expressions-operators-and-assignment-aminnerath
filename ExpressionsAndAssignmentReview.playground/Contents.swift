/* Overview
 
 Your assignment is to create your own programming problem using variables, operators, and assignment. Think about the Operators playground you completed. This assignment is like you are producing a page for that assignment. You will work on your playground page in a playground cloned from GitHub. It should include *at least* the following:
 
 - three arithmetic operators
 - one compound operator
 - three variables
 - one type conversion
 
 It's not very exciting to have a bunch of random numbers in code. When writing this problem you should be creating a story around it. This need not be tremendously complex, just a simple story that motivates the values being used and gives them a context.
 
 For example 40 / 5 isn't interesting, but writing a tree planting app that given a species of tree and how much space you have will estimate how many trees you can plant is moreso. (e.g., I have 40 sq ft and want to plant walnut trees. They need 5 sq ft of growing space around the trunk, how many can I fit?).
 
 You should write your story bits in comments (e.g., between /* and */, or lines starting with // ) around where the code should go.

//Jeff and Andrea have seperate accounts and they keep a cash account at home.  One account has 100 dollars in it and another account has 200. At home they keep 500 dollats.  Create a budget of how much they have to pay bills with.

var bank1:Double=100
var bank2:Double=200
var cash:Double=500
let total=bank1+bank2+cash
//The best advice is to pay bills first then plan trip.  Print this advice.
print("Pay bills first,then plan trip")
//The bills to be paid are a credit card and a student loan.  The credit card payment is 50 and the student loan is 100.
// print the total bill amount
var creditPayment=50
var studentLoan=100
var bills=creditPayment+studentLoan
print(bills)
//Since you should always pay more than minium due you sometimes need a reminder.  Print why and a reminder
print("Pay more down to avoid interest")
var bills=(creditPayment+studentLoan)*2
print(bills)
//what does this amount mean?  print this answer
Print("This is how much to budget out to pay everything that is due!")
Print(total
// Be sarcastic and print a statement
Print("Look at all the cash")
Var paybill:Double=total-bills
Print(paybill)
//How do you think Jeff and Andrea feel after paying bills? Print your answer
Print("Ouch!That sure went fast")
//Andrea is signed up for cash back rewards.  However only one account has this option.  Take the lowest account multiple by 2 and add 50.
Print("Cash back rewards came. Add to bank1")
bank1=(100*2)+50
 // Sometimes things come up unexpected in a budget. Today the kids needed lunch. The lunch is 20.  Adjust accordingly and print reason
Print("Kids need lunch.")
var lunch=20
bank1=(100*2)+50 -lunch
print (paybill)
// What do you think was the largest influence in the budget?  Print your answer
print("It pays to do cash back rewards")
